# Water Quality Analytical Reports  

These reports contain water quality test results for a number of Inorganic and Metals parameters for Fairfax
Waterâ€™s source and treated waters. Many of the parameterslisted in these reports are commonly requested data from our customers. Examples of these common parameters are pH, Chlorine, Alkalinity, Hardness, and Lead. Additional information about [water hardness](http://www.fairfaxwater.org/water/hardness.htm) may be found by, and [lead](http://www.fairfaxwater.org/water/lead.htm).  

If your residence is located more to the north end of the county it will generally receive water from the Corbalis Treatment Plant and more southern locations from from the Griffith Treatment Plant.
